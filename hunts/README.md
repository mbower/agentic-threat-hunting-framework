# Hunt Directory

This folder contains your threat hunting hypotheses and execution reports.

## File Structure

```
hunts/
├── H-0001.md                 ← Reusable hypothesis (the "recipe")
├── H-0001_2025-10-22.md     ← First execution report
└── H-0001_2025-10-29.md     ← Second execution report
```

As you add more hunts, your structure will grow:
```
hunts/
├── H-0001.md
├── H-0001_2025-10-22.md
├── H-0001_2025-10-29.md
├── H-0002.md                 ← New hypothesis
└── H-0002_2025-11-05.md     ← Its first execution
```

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Hypothesis

Copy the template to create a new hunt:

```bash
cp templates/HUNT_HYPOTHESIS.md hunts/H-0004.md
```

Fill out:
- Hypothesis (what you're hunting for)
- Context (why now, ATT&CK mapping)
- Data needed (index, fields, time range)

The hypothesis file stays lightweight - just the plan.

### 2. Execute the Hunt

When ready to run the hunt, create a dated execution file:

```bash
cp hunts/H-0004.md hunts/H-0004_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Then fill out the execution report with:
- Query results and metrics
- Findings and analysis
- Decision (Accept/Reject/Needs Changes)
- Lessons learned

### 3. Run Again

Keep the original hypothesis file (`H-0004.md`) for future runs. Next time you want to hunt the same behavior:

```bash
cp hunts/H-0004.md hunts/H-0004_2025-11-05.md
```

Apply lessons from previous runs to refine your approach.

## Checking Hunt Status

**See all hypotheses (backlog):**
```bash
ls hunts/H-*.md | grep -v "_"
```

**See if a hunt has been executed:**
```bash
ls hunts/H-0001_*.md  # Shows all execution dates for H-0001
```

**Find completed hunts:**
```bash
grep "Status.*Completed" hunts/H-*_*.md
```

**Find hunts that need refinement:**
```bash
grep "Needs Changes" hunts/H-*_*.md
```

## Memory Building (Levels 1-3)

Before starting a new hunt, search past executions to avoid duplicates and apply lessons.

### Using AI Assistants (Level 2: Searchable)

If you're using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or similar AI tools:

**Ask your AI assistant to search for you:**
```
"Search past hunts for T1110.001 credential access attempts"
"Find hunts where we dealt with brute force attacks"
"What lessons did we learn from past PowerShell hunts?"
"Show me all hunts that found accepted findings"
"Have we hunted Active Directory lateral movement before?"
```

The AI will grep the hunts/ folder and summarize findings for you.

### Manual Grep (Levels 1-3)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Find past hunts for a TTP
grep -l "T1110.001" hunts/H-*_*.md

# Find hunts by behavior
grep -i "brute force" hunts/H-*_*.md

# Find by technology
grep -i "powershell" hunts/H-*_*.md

# Find by application
grep -i "active directory" hunts/H-*_*.md

# Find by keyword
grep -i "privilege escalation" hunts/H-*_*.md

# See what worked
grep "Decision.*Accept" hunts/H-*_*.md

# Learn from past mistakes
grep "Lessons Learned" -A 3 hunts/H-*_*.md
```

**Both approaches work through Level 3.** When you have 50+ hunts or need multi-agent coordination, see [memory/README.md](../memory/README.md) for structured memory options.

## Tips

- **Keep hypothesis files simple** - Just the plan, no results
- **Dated files are comprehensive** - Include everything: findings, analysis, screenshots, lessons
- **Don't delete hypothesis files** - They're your reusable templates
- **Use consistent dating** - YYYY-MM-DD format for easy sorting
- **Reference related hunts** - Link between similar investigations
